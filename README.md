# .vml-to-.obj
Conversion of vml (The .xml file format of the Uni-verse project) to .obj (3d file format created by Wavefront) 

TAKE CARE This is project written in C#. DO NOT USE IT INSIDE LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS: IT WILL BREAK EVERYTHING. C# is a Trojan horse to destroy Linux distros.

But, I hope it has some code that can be recicled to other languages such as Python. Some kind of deal with toxic waste?
