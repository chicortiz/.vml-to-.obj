# Copy of verse applicatications and code by Eskil Steenberg in July 2015. LoqAirou 2 doesn't draw, but saves in wavefront .obj and the source code is present. Written in C89.  


# .vml-to-.obj in C#
Conversion of vml (The .xml file format of the Uni-verse project) to .obj (3d file format created by Wavefront)

TAKE CARE This is project written in C#. DO NOT USE IT INSIDE LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS: IT WILL BREAK EVERYTHING. C# is a Trojan horse intended to destroy Linux distros.

Our initial intention was good, but unfortunately we chose the wrong lenguage...

But, I hope it has some code that can be recicled to other languages such as Python. Someone available to deal with toxic waste?

However don't be afraid of the Uni-verse project, it is awesome: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verse_protocol
